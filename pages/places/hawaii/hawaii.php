                        Pearl Harbor, is the center of the tourist attraction on the Big Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Some
                        important memorial sites can be traveled by bus. It is recommended to get your tour tickets
                        early
                        online. But tickets are also available on-site at the USS Arizona Memorial, which is the focal
                        point
                        of the historic event in WWII. It is an excellent time to pay tribute tho those who served and
                        sacrificed their lives to defend the country.
                        Just around the corner is the Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park. I was privileged to visit Pearl
                        Harbor in 2015; it is like Deja Vu in the 1940's. The submarine is well preserved. You can
                        imagine
                        how it is to be a Navy crew during those times. You will be provided with a recorded audio that
                        narrates about the parts of the submarine. Near the area the torpedoes are well
